/**
 * @file hal_pwm.c
 * @brief PWM initialization and 6-step commutation (AK port).
 *
 * Forked from CK `../../garuda_6step_ck.X/hal/hal_pwm.c` VERBATIM.
 * dsPIC33AK128MC106 inherits the same PWM Generator peripheral SFR set
 * (MPER, MDC, MPHASE, PGxCONL/H, PGxIOCONL/H, PGxDC, PGxPER, PGxTRIG*)
 * from the same IP block as dsPIC33CK — the bit fields used here are
 * documented in DS70005527 and were spot-checked against the AK FOC
 * sibling `../../dspic33AKESC/hal/hal_pwm.c`.
 *
 * EV92R69A + EV68M17A PWM pin mapping (different from CK EV43F54A):
 *   PG1: RD2(PWM1H) / RD3(PWM1L) — Phase A     (DIM 1 / DIM 3)
 *   PG2: RD0(PWM2H) / RD1(PWM2L) — Phase B     (DIM 5 / DIM 7)
 *   PG3: RC3(PWM3H) / RC4(PWM3L) — Phase C     (DIM 2 / DIM 4)
 * These pins are AK PWM-dedicated (PG1H/L etc are fixed-function on
 * those pins per the AK pinout), so no PPS routing is needed beyond
 * the TRIS=0 in port_config.c.
 *
 * Center-aligned complementary mode, POLH=Active-low (ATA6847L expects
 * active-low high-side inputs), POLL=Active-high — same convention as
 * CK because the ATA6847L gate driver is unchanged.
 *
 * PG1 = master (SOC update), PG2/PG3 = slaves (slaved SOC update).
 * MPER = LOOPTIME_TCY sets the switching period.
 *
 * [AK PORT] Verified against DS70005539 §14:
 *  - MPER/MDC/MPHASE are 16-bit programmable (in a 20-bit field where
 *    the bottom 4 bits are Reserved for AK's High-Resolution PWM mode).
 *    LOOPTIME_TCY @ uint16_t fits 60 kHz / 40 kHz / 20 kHz carriers.
 *  - PG1CONH = 0x4800 decodes correctly: MPERSEL=1 (use MPER), MSTEN=1
 *    (broadcast EOC to clients), UPDMOD=000 (SOC update).
 *  - PG2CONH = PG3CONH = 0x4200 decode correctly: MPERSEL=1,
 *    UPDMOD=010 (Client SOC — wait for master's broadcast).
 *  - PG1CONL/PG2CONL/PG3CONL = 0x000C: CLKSEL=01 (use clock per MCLKSEL),
 *    MODSEL=100 (Center-Aligned PWM).  Same on AK.
 *  - PCLKCON FIXED: AK is 1-bit MCLKSEL (was 2-bit on CK).  Now writes
 *    0x0001 to route CLKGEN5 (400 MHz) to PWM, instead of CK's 0x0002.
 *
 * [AK PORT] Still needs scope-time validation:
 *  1. PG1TRIGA midpoint trigger fires ADC ISR at correct PWM phase
 *     (register exists with same name; bit-field count may differ).
 *  2. OVRENH/OVRENL bypass duty compare in BLK mode.
 *  3. PGxIOCONL/H POLH/POLL pin polarities for ATA6847L (active-low HS).
 *  4. DTH/DTL dead-time register width (may be 20-bit on AK).
