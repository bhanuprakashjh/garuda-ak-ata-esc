/**
 * @file hal_com_timer.c
 * @brief SCCP4 free-running HR timer + SCCP3 one-shot commutation scheduler.
 *
 * Two cooperating SCCP modules:
 *
 *   SCCP4 — Free-running 16-bit timer at 640 ns/tick (wraps every 41.9 ms).
 *           Provides HR timestamps via HAL_ComTimer_ReadTimer() for ZC
 *           interval measurement and predictor state. NEVER fires an ISR.
 *
 *   SCCP3 — One-shot scheduler in Time Base mode (MOD=0000). Each
 *           HAL_ComTimer_ScheduleAbsolute() resets CCP3TMR to 0 and
 *           sets CCP3PR = (target - now), so when CCP3TMR reaches
 *           PRL the timer period match fires _CCT3Interrupt exactly
 *           once (one-shot via CCT3IE clear in the ISR).
 *
 * Why two modules: SCCP4 OC mode (MOD=0001) does NOT raise CCP4IF on
 * hardware compare match on this device — only manual `_CCP4IF=1`
 * works. Empirically tested with OCAEN=0 and OCAEN=1; neither
 * generates the interrupt. The Time Base CCTxIF path is the proven
 * working pattern (SCCP1 fast poll uses it at 100kHz reliably), so
 * SCCP3 in that mode is the cleanest hardware-precise scheduler.
 *
 * Both modules share the same Fp/64 = 1.5625 MHz clock, so their
 * tick units are identical and HR timestamps map 1:1 onto schedule
 * delays.
